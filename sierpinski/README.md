<h1>Sierpinski</h1>
<p>This is a function that draws a 2d Sierpinski triangle on the x and z axis</p>
<p>To use stand in what would be the upper left hand corner, keep in mind that the function draws in the positive x and z directions, type "/function serpinski:setup" and the function takes care of the rest!</p>
<p>If you want to change the size of the triangle just edit all instances of the number 65 in loop to whatever you want (it tend to look best with numbers in the set [3,5,9,17,33,65] basically take the previous number, double it, and subtract one)</p>
<p>Also if you want to make a very large one and are worried about the armor stand unloading just delete the first two line of setup (make sure you delete any armor stands with the tag cursor! this can be done with /kill @e[type=armor_stand,tag=cursor]) and replace it with <b>scoreboard players tag @p add cursor</b>. This will make the player the cursor. The program will take control of your player till it is done. You can stop it but either running /gamerule gameLoopFunction clear or /scoreboard players tag <playername> remove cursor. You can come and go from the world without and affect if the program needs to run for multiple sessions.</p>
